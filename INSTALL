1) Built on Linux with Python 2.7.  Requires that mysqld/mariadb and the
   rtl-sdr tools be installed.  Tested on Linux

2) Install pyrtlsdr (e.g. by using pip2)

3) Setup and start mysqld

4) Edit fwsetup.sql to reflect your preferences (including password)

5) From the freqwatch directory: $ mysql -u root -p < fwsetup.sql

6) Edit freqwatch.conf to reflect the database settings (and password),
   as well as your rtl-sdr stick configurations

7) Change permissions on freqwatch.conf so your db password isn't visible to others.

8) To use monitors based on the modified rtl_fm, change to the rtl_fm_new
   directory and run 'make'.  You can change the CHUNK_SIZE define in the
   modified source to suit your needs.  You may have to adjust your sql
   server configuration and increase max_allowed_packet if you run into
   issues.
